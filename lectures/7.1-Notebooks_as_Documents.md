## Not Just for Code

> Markdown and Notebooks can be used for a lot more than just code! In conjunction with Pandoc and/or LaTeX they become platforms for publication.

---
### Recall: Tangled Workflows

It's not *just* about mixing code and comment, we *also* want:

- To separate *content* from *presentation*
- To define *mappings* between presentation styles
- To produce the *best-quality* output for the format chosen

![](https://hackernoon.com/images/126z19ld.jpg)

^ Examples of this include CSS for web sites, LaTeX templates, and Markdown styles.
^ [MVC approach](https://hackernoon.com/beginners-guide-to-ruby-on-rails-mvc-model-view-controller-pattern-4z19196a) to software design.

---
### Pandoc

Tool for converting documents *between* formats, including:

- Plain Text/YAML
- Markdown
- LaTeX/PDF
- HTML/Reveal.js
- Jupyter Notebook
- XML/ODT/DOCX
- EPUB/DocBook
- BibTeX/JSON

---
### LaTeX

Intended for [type-setting of scientific documents](https://www.latex-project.org/about/), but has been used for slides, posters, CVs, etc. It is *not* a word processor, it's more like a *compiler*.

<div width="100%">
<img width="49%" src="https://github.com/jreades/i2p/raw/master/lectures/img/LaTeX-1.png">
<img width="49%" src="https://github.com/jreades/i2p/raw/master/lectures/img/LaTeX-2.png">
</div>

^ This format is based on Edward Tufte's VSQD and can be found on [GitHub](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/).

---
### LaTeX in Practice

You  write LaTeX in any text editor, but specialist apps like [Texpad](https://www.texpad.com/) or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) make it easier.

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,article,oneside]{memoir}
\newcommand{\bl}{\textsc{bl}~\/}
\usepackage{tabularx}

\begin{document}
\maketitle 

This report provides an overview of activities ...

\section{Applications}
A primary objective was the submission...
```

^ UCL has an institutional license for Overleaf. 
^ This document is then *compiled* (or 'typeset') with the commands provided by the preamble being interpreted and applied. Depending on the length of the document and sophistication of the styles it can take up to 3 or 4 minutes for a book-length document, but small documents should compile in a few seconds.

^ Compilation allows us to do things like have Master Documents that actually work, include PDFs, make forwards and backwards references.

---
### BibTeX

Provides bilbiographic support for LaTeX but widely used by other utilities as is *also* plain-text.

```bibtex
@article{Lavin:2019,
        Author = {Lavin, Matthew J.},
        Doi = {10.46430/phen0082},
        Journal = {The Programming Historian},
        Number = {8},
        Title = {Analyzing Documents with TF-IDF},
        Year = {2019},
        Bdsk-Url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0082}}

@incollection{Kitchin:2016,
        Author = {Kitchin, R. and Lauriault, T.P. and McArdie, G.},
        Booktitle = {Smart Urbanism},
        Chapter = {2},
        Editor = {Marvin, Luque-Ayala, McFarlane},
        Title = {Smart Cities and the Politics of Urban Data},
        Year = {2016}}
```

---
### BibTeX in Practice

To reference a document we then need to tell LaTeX or Pandoc where to look:

```latex
\bibliographystyle{apacite} # LaTeX
\bibliography{Spatial_Data_Chapter.bib} # LaTeX
```

With citations following formats like:

```latex
\citep[p.22]{Reades2018} # LaTeX
```

Or: 

```markdown
[@dignazio:2020, chap. 4] # Markdown
```

---
### Reveal.js

JavaScript-based presentation framework. Can use Markdown (using the separator `---` to separate slides) to generate portable interactive slides including references/bibliographies.

Compare:

- https://github.com/darribas/wmn/blob/master/src/slidedecks/lecture_01.html

### From Markdown...

```bash
pandoc Syllabus.md \
  -H ./bib/head.tex \
  -H ./bib/chapter.tex \
  -H ./bib/refs.tex \
  -V documentclass=memoir \
  --pdf-engine=xelatex \
  --filter=pandoc-citeproc \
  --metadata-file=metadata.yml \
  --highlight-style=pygments \
  -o Syllabus.pdf
```

#### Pros

- Simplicity (while writing)
- Flexibility of Form
- Version Control
- High-Quality Outputs
- Enforced Structure

+++
#### Cons

- Complexity (when formatting)
- Collaboration (can be harder)

^ If your document lacks structure (headings, sub-headings, etc.) then it's *impossible* to get a good-looking document. 

^ Conversely, _because_ LaTeX and Markdown force you to add structure they ensure that things like ToCs, ToFs, and Bibliographies will generally work 'as advertised'.

## Recap of Formatting

---
### Headings

| Markdown              | LaTeX                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `# Heading Level 1`   | `\section{Heading Level 1}`       |
| `## Heading Level 2`  | `\subsection{Heading Level 2}`    |
| `### Heading Level 3` | `\subsubsection{Heading Level 3}` |

---
### Inline Elements

| Markdown     | LaTeX                               |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `1. Numbered item 1` | `\begin{enumerate} \n \item ... \end{enumerate}` |
| `- Bulleted list item 1` | `\begin{itemize} \n \item ... \n \end{itemize} ` |
| `_italics_` or `*italics*` | `\emph{italics}` or `\textit{italics}` |
| `**bold**` | `\textbf{bold}` |
| `> blockquote`  | `\begin{quote} \n blockquote \end{quote}` |
| ``Some `code` is here`` | `Some \texttt{code} is here` |
| `[Link Text](URL)` | `\href{Link Text}{URL}` |
| `![Alt Text](Image URL)` | ```\begin{figure}\n \includegraphics[opts]{...}\n \end{figure}``` |

---
### Mathematics

| Markdown         | LaTeX          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Same as LaTex with 2 $'s | `$x=5$`        |
| Same as LaTex with 2 $'s | `$\pi$`        |
| Same as LaTex with 2 $'s | `$e = mc^{2}$` |

We can show all this directly _in_ the Notebook!
$$\pi$$; $$e = mc^{2}$$; $$\int_{0}^{\inf} x^2 \,dx$$; $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$$

Overleaf [has good documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Main_Page) for most (basic) applications.
