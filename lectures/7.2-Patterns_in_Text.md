# Patterns in Text

## Abstracting Text

Dictionaries-of-Lists are to Numeric Data 

...as...

Regular Expressions are to Textual Data?

---
### *Describing* Character Sequences?

Consider the following character sequences:

- foo@bar.com
- https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/
- (555) 102-1111
- E17 5RS
- Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour / Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in / Another moon. But, oh, methinks how slow / This old moon wanes. She lingers my desires, / Like to a stepdame or a dowager / Long withering out a young manâ€™s revenue. (I.i.) 

^ We need ways to distinguish: Upper and Lower Case, Digits, Space Characters, Other Characters, Repetition, Type... these are things that Regular Expressions help us to achieve.

---
### Applications of RegExes

If our problem follows some set of articulable *rules* about permissible sequences of characters then we can *probably* validate it using a regex:

| Examples                                | More Examples                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Email                                   | Password                                  |
| Postcode                                | Phone number                              |
| Date                                    | Credit cards                              |
| Web scraping                      | Syntax highlighting                       |
| Sentence structure                            | Data wrangling                            |
| Searching for/within<br />files/content | Lexical analysis/<br />Language detection |

^ These are all good problems...

---
### But...

String methods are _not_ enough:

```python
>>> '123foo456'.index('foo')
2
>>> '123foo456'.split('foo')
['123', '456']
>>> ' 123 foo 456 '.strip()
'123 foo 456'
>>> 'HOW NOW BROWN COW?'.lower()
'how now brown cow?'
>>> 'How now brown cow?'.replace('brown ','green-')
'How now green-cow?'
```

See: `dir(str)` for full list of string methods.

---
## Regular Expressions

Regexes are a way for talking _about_ patterns observed in text, although their origins are rooted in philosophy and linguistics.

Implemented in Python as:

```python
import re
# re.search(<regex>, <str>)
s = '123foo456'
if re.search('123',s):
  print("Found a match.")
else:
  print("No match.")
```

Prints `'Found a match.'`

---
### Capturing Matches

```python
m = re.search('123',s)
print(m.start())
print(m.end())
print(m.span())
print(m.group())
```

Outputs:

```python
0
3
(0,3)
123
```

^ So, we have `None` if a search fails, but if it succeeds then we have attributes of the `match` objection like start, end, span, and group (this last is going to be particularly interesting since it tells us what matched).

---
### Configuring Matches

```python
m = re.search('FOO',s)
print(m)
m = re.search('FOO',s,re.IGNORECASE)
print(m)
```

Outputs:

```python
None
<re.Match object; span=(3, 6), match='foo'>
```

The third parameter allows us to: match newlines (`re.DOTALL`), ignore case (`re.IGNORECASE`), take language into account (`re.LOCALE`), match across lines (`re.MULTILINE`), and write patterns across multiple lines (`re.VERBOSE`). If you need multiple options it's `re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE`. Bitwise again!

---
### More Than One Match

```python
s = '123foo456foo789'
lst = re.findall('foo',s)
print(lst)
lst = re.finditer('foo',s)
[x for x in lst]
rs  = re.sub('foo',' ',s)
print(rs)
rs  = re.split(' ',rs)
print(rs)
```

Outputs:

```python
['foo','foo']
[<re.Match object; span=(3, 6), match='foo'>, <re.Match object; span=(9, 12), match='foo'>]
'123 456 789'
['123', '456', '789']
```

## Let's Get Meta

---
### Regular Expressions Do *Much* More

```python
>>> import re
>>> m = re.search('\$((\d+,){2,}\d+)',
		"'That will be $1,000,000 he said...'")
>>> m.group(1)
'1,000,000'
```

This is not even scratching the surface, but it allows to look for sequences of 1-or-more digits followed by a comma... and for those sequence to repeat two or more times, ending with a sequence of digits. The rest is ignored.

---
### Character Classes

| Characters | Regex Meta Class Options | 'Antonyms' |
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :--------- |
| a...z      | `[a-z]`, `\w` (word-like characters)  | `[^a-z]`, `\W` |
| A...Z      | `[A-Z]`, `\w` (word-like characters)  | `[^A-Z]`, `\W` |
| 0...9      | `[0-9]`, `\d` (digits)                | `[^0-9]`, `\D` |
| `' '`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\f`, `\v`   | `\s`  | `\S` |
| `.`, `[`, `]`, `+`, `$`, `^`, `\|`, `{`, `}`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `?` | For safety always precede character with a `\`. | None  |

*Note:*  `\w` will include `_`. And `\` is, once again, important as it 'escapes' various characters, and options.

---
### Metacharacters

| Metacharacter | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| .             | Any character at all                       |
| ^             | Start of a string/line                     |
| $             | End of a string/line                       |
| *             | 0 or more of something                     |
| +             | 1 or more of something                     |
| ?             | 0 or 1 of something; also lazy modifier                        |
| {m,n}         | Between m and n of something               |
| [ ]           | A set of character literals                |
| ( )           | Group/remember this sequence of characters |
| \|            | Or                                         |

## I am Completely Lost

^ Let's take some real regexes and try to make sense of them.

---

### Building Blocks

| Regex               | Interpretation                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `r'\s*'`            | 0 or more spaces                                             |
| `r'\d+'`            | 1 or more digits                                             |
| `r'[A-Fa-f0-7]{5}'` | Exactly 5 hexadecimal 'digits'                               |
| `r'\w+\.\d{2,}'`    | 1 or more 'wordish' characters, followed by a full-stop, then 2 or more digits |
| `r'^[^@]+@\w+'`     | One more non-@ characters at the start of a line, followed by a '@' then 1 or more 'wordish' characters. |
| `r'(uk\|eu\|fr)$'`    | The characters 'uk' or 'eu' or 'fr' at the end of a line.    |

---
### What's This?

```python
re.match(r'^[^@]+@([a-z0-9\-]+\.){1,5}[a-z0-9\-]+$', s)
```

^ `s` should be replaced with any string you want to check.

---
### What's This?

```python
re.match(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', s)
```

---
### What's This?

```python
re.match(r'^\s*$', s)
```

---
### What's This?

```python
re.match(r'^(http|https|ftp):[\/]{2}([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.){1,4}[a-zA-Z]{2,5}(:[0-9]+)?\/?([a-zA-Z0-9\-\._\?\'\/\\\+\&\%\$#\=~]*)',s)
```

---
### What's This?

```python
re.match(r'([Gg][Ii][Rr] 0[Aa]{2})|((([A-Za-z][0-9]{1,2})|(([A-Za-z][A-Ha-hJ-Yj-y][0-9]{1,2})|(([A-Za-z][0-9][A-Za-z])|([A-Za-z][A-Ha-hJ-Yj-y][0-9][A-Za-z]?))))\s?[0-9][A-Za-z]{2})',s)
```

---
### To Help...

`re.VERBOSE` to the rescue:

```python
regex = r"""
([GIR] 0[A]{2})| 	# Girobank 
(
  (
    ([A-Z][0-9]{1,2})| # e.g A00...Z99
      (
        ([A-Z][A-HJ-Y][0-9]{1,2})|  # e.g. AB54...ZX11
          (([A-Z][0-9][A-Z])|  # e.g. A0B...Z9Z 
          ([A-Z][A-HJ-Y][0-9][A-Z]?))  # e.g. WC1 or WC1H
        )
      )
    \s?[0-9][A-Z]{2} # e.g. 5RX
  )
"""
re.match(regex,s,re.VERBOSE|re.IGNORECASE) # Can also use: re.X|re.I
```

^ This is the [government's own regex](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488478/Bulk_Data_Transfer_-_additional_validation_valid_from_12_November_2015.pdf) but is probably *not* 100% accurate.
