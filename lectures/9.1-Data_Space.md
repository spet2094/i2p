### Cashier Income as DGP

*Question*: Retail cashier annual salaries have a Normal distribution with a mean equal to $25,000 and a standard deviation equal to $2,000. What is the probability that a randomly selected retail cashier earns more than $27,000?

*Answer*: 15.87%

*Result*: All models are wrong, but some are useful (George Box)

## Distance...

## So...

Instinctively, we know that Bill Gates' wealth is much further from 'normal' than is his height. But **how**?

- How can we *compare* income and height if they share no common units?
- How can we compare the biodiversity of sites in the tropics with those of sub-Arctic areas given that there are different numbers of species to begin with?

We need ways to **make different dimensions comparable**, and we need ways **to remove unit effects from distance measures**.

### Distance in 1D

$$
d(i,j) = (i_{1}-j_{1})
$$

---
### Distance in 2D

$$
d(i,j) = \sqrt{(i_{1}-j_{1})^{2}+(i_{2}-j_{2})^{2}}
$$

### Distance in 3D... or More

We can keep adding dimensions...

$$
d(i,j) = \sqrt{(i_{1}-j_{1})^{2}+(i_{2}-j_{2})^{2}+(i_{3}-j_{3})^{2}}
$$

You continue adding dimensions indefinitely, but from here on out you are dealing with hyperspaces!

### Thinking in *Data* Space

We can write the coordinates of an observation with 3 attributes (*e.g*. height, weight, income) as:
$$
x_{i} = \\\{ {x_{i1}, x_{i2}, x_{i3} } \\\}
$$
 And we can think of something with 8 attributes (*e.g*. height, weight, income, age, year of birth, ...) as occupying an *8-dimensional space* (which, for obvious reasons, we canâ€™t plot in one go).

### Two Propositions

> 1. That geographical space is **no different** from any other dimension in a data set.
> 2. That geographical space is **still special** when it comes to thinking about relationships.
