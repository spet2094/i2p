# Dimensionality
## Curse and Blessing...

---
## Consider...

- More dimensions means **more information**.
- More dimensions makes for **easier seperation**.
- More dimensions **inflates distance**.
- More dimensions increases the **risk of overfitting**.

Or as [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/curse-of-dimensionality-and-what-beginners-should-do-to-overcome-it/) puts it:

- High-dimensional spaces have geometrical properties that are counter-intuitive and far from the properties observed in two- or three-dimensional spaces.
- Data analysis tools are often designed with intuitive properties and low-dimensional spaces in mind.

## Dimensionality Reduction

### PCA

Workhorse dimensionality reduction method: simple, fast, and effective. Can be thought of as freely rotating axes to align with directions of maximum variance. I like this summary:

> PCA (Principal Components Analysis) gives us our ideal set of features. It creates a set of principal components that are **rank ordered by variance** (the first component has higher variance than the second, the second has higher variance than the third, and so on), **uncorrelated** (all components are orthogonal), and **low in number** (we can throw away the lower ranked components as they contain little signal).

But I particularly liked [this exposition](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pca-fae3e243731d) in Towards Data Science.

---
### In Practice...

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(data)
print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
print(pca.singular_values_)
pca.transform(data)
```

See also: [Kernel PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA) for non-linear problems.

### RT(F)M

Why was I banging on about transformations?

> Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space. The input data is **centered but not scaled** for each feature before applying the SVD.

I found a nice explanation of PCA using dinner conversation over several bottles of wine as an example on [Stats.StackExhcange.com](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/140579). There are [many good illustrations](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/385782) of this process on [stats.stackexchange.com](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/385775/normalizing-vs-scaling-before-pca).



---
### Other Considerations

> PCA is a form of unsupervised learning that does not take output labels into account. Other approaches (such as Linear Discriminant Analysis [note: *not* Latent Dirichlet Allocation]) consider the output as part of the transformation. PCA is also deterministic.

See [this discussion](https://stackabuse.com/implementing-lda-in-python-with-scikit-learn/).

### t-SNE

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding is best understood as a **visualisation** technique, not an **analytical** one. This is because it is *probabilistic* and not *deterministic*. 

![](img/tsne-fashion.png)

---
### In Practice...

```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
TSNE().fit_transform(<data>)
```

However, the choice of `perplexity` and `n_iter` at instantiation *matters*. In practice you will need to experiment with both.

t-SNE is also *much* harder computationally and it may be preferrable on very high-D data sets to **apply PCA *first* and then t-SNE to the reduced data set**! The output could then be fed to a clustering algorithm to make predictions about where new observations belong, but do not confuse that with *meaning*.

*Note:* I have also installed the [Multicore-TSNE](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE) module in the Docker/Vagrant image.

---
### UMAP

Promising (non-deterministic) alternative to PCA that supports non-linear reduction while preserving both local and global structure. Not currently installed in Docker/Vagrant, but available under `umap-learn` (`conda install -c conda-forge umap-learn`). See examples on [umap.scikit-tda.org](https://umap.scikit-tda.org/parameters.html).

### Gotcha!

Both t-SNE and UMAP require very careful handling:

1. Hyperparameters matter
2. Cluster size means nothing
3. Cluster distances mean nothing
4. Clusters may mean nothing (low neighbour count/perplexity)
5. Outputs are stochastic (*not* deterministic)

Both likely require repeated testing and experimentation.

### Other Approaches

- Feature selection, including forwards/backwards (`sklearn.feature_selection` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection))
- Decomposition (`sklearn.decomposition` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.decomposition))
- Other types of manifold learning (`sklearn.manifold` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.manifold))
- Random projection (`sklearn.random_projection` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.random_projection))
- Support Vector Machines (`sklearn.svm` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.svm))
- Ensemble Methods (such as Random Forests: `sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and `sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html) and [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor))
