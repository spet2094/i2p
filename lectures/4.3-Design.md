# Designing Objects

---
## Basic Principles

Three key concepts:
1. Encapsulation: the bundling of the data and the methods that work on that data in **one unit**; data is *often* accessed via **methods** and not directly. I don't need to care **how** something works, only **that** it works.
2. Inheritance: classes can **inherit** functionality from 'parents' and then **extend** this in useful ways. So `geopandas` extends `pandas`, and `movingpandas` extends `geopandas`!
3. Polymorphism: a 'child' class can ideally be used anywhere its parent class can be used because it only **extends** (*i.e.* adds) functionality and does *not* break parent behaviour. A class that implements functionality from multiple parents can be used anywhere those parents would be used.

	Not Bacteria
		Archaea
			Pyrodicticum
			Thermoproteus
			...
		Eukaryota
			Entamoebae
			Slime Molds
			Animals
			Fungi
			Plants
			Ciliates

## Tree of Vehicles

Most people would call this a class hierarchy or diagram.

{{org-chart}}
Vehicle
	Small
		Bicycle
		Motorcycle
	Medium
		Sedan
		Coupé
		Estate
	Large
		Bus
		Van
		Tractor

  There is **no natural order here**: where do unicycles or rickshaws go?

## Classes vs Packages

> Functionally, a class and a package are indistinguishable, but a _class_ produces objects that use functions and constants, whereas a _package_ is a group of functions and constants that may, or may not, include classes.

Ugh, now try to keep _this_ straight in your head.

## Key Takeaways

1. You’ve been using Classes and Methods since you started. 
2. You can ‘package up’ useful code into functions, and useful functions into packages.
3. Together, packages and classes will turbo-charge your programming skills.
4. You can stand on the shoulders of giants!
